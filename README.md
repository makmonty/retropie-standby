# RetroPie standby script

This is a script to put a Raspberry Pi with RetroPie to a standby state and to wake up.

The idea is to turn off the following resources:

- Video output
- Network
- Unpair bluetooth devices

And to wake up when a bluetooth device is paired again, or a key of the keyboard is pressed.
